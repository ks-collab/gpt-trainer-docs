title: "Meta Integration Process"
---

To integrate Meta (Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp) with your GPT-trainer, follow these steps:

## 1. Create a Meta App

First, you need to create a Meta App of the "Business" type to access the necessary messaging APIs. Refer to [Meta's guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app/other-app-types) for detailed instructions on how to do this.

## 2. Obtain App Secrets

Once your Meta App is created, navigate to the "App settings" section in your Meta App Dashboard. Here, you will find your **App ID** and **App Secret**. Copy these values and paste them into the "Integrations" tab of your GPT-trainer Partners Dashboard.

You also need to generate a **Verification Token**. This can be any secure alphanumeric string (at least 32 characters is recommended). You can use a password generator for this. Enter this token in the designated field within the GPT-trainer Partners Dashboard and save it for your records.

## 3. Add Products to Your App

In your Meta App Dashboard, go to the main **Dashboard** page and add the following products to your app:

- **Facebook Login for Business**
- **Messenger**
- **WhatsApp for Business**
- **Instagram**

## 4. Configure Webhooks

Navigate to the **Webhooks** section of your Meta App. You will need to configure webhook subscriptions for **Pages**, **Instagram**, and **WhatsApp Business**. Ensure you are using **API version 20.0** for all webhooks.

For each of the following subscriptions:

1. Click **Edit Configuration**.
   - **Callback URL**: Enter the following URL, replacing `<your-domain>` with your actual domain:

     ```
     https://<your-domain>/messenger/webhook
     ```
   - **Verification Token**: Use the verification token you previously saved in the GPT-trainer Partners Dashboard.
2. **Test** the **messages** webhook. You should see the message:

   > "The sample update was successfully sent to your server."
   > Then click **Subscribe** on **Messages**.
3. If you experience duplicated messages after testing, **unsubscribe** from **Messages** and try the test and subscription again.

## 5. Configure Facebook Login for Business

Go to **Facebook Login for Business → Configurations** in your Meta App Dashboard and create three separate configurations:

1. **Messenger**
   - **Login Variation**: General
   - **Access Token**: User Access Token
   - **Authorizations**:

     ```
     pages_messaging
     instagram_basic
     instagram_manage_messages
     pages_show_list
     business_management
     pages_manage_metadata
     pages_read_engagement
     ```
2. **Instagram**
   - **Login Variation**: General
   - **Access Token**: User Access Token
   - **Authorizations**:

     ```
     pages_messaging
     pages_show_list
     pages_manage_metadata
     pages_read_engagement
     instagram_basic
     instagram_manage_messages
     business_management
     ```
3. **WhatsApp**
   - **Login Variation**: whatsapp_embedded_signup
   - **Resources**: WhatsApp account
   - **Authorizations**:

     ```
     whatsapp_business_management
     whatsapp_business_messaging
     business_management
     pages_manage_metadata
     pages_show_list
     ```

For each integration you wish to add (Facebook Messenger, Instagram, or WhatsApp), copy the **Configuration ID** found under the respective configuration in the "Facebook Login for Business" tab and paste it into your GPT-trainer Partners Dashboard.

## 6. Please enter your white label platform.

Then, connect the associated meta app with a demo account (WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram); you will need separate connections for separate apps, but they can all connect to the same chatbot.

Then, make an API call by sending a message. The message may not appear.

> Note: Only after connecting the demo account can you access step 6; you may need to wait for 24 hours after connecting and making a successful API call before Step 6 becomes available to you

## 7. Request Advanced Access

You will need to request **Advanced Access** for the following permissions by filling out the necessary form in your Meta App Dashboard:

 1. `pages_messaging`
 2. `pages_manage_metadata`
 3. `public_profile`
 4. `pages_show_list`
 5. `whatsapp_business_messaging`
 6. `instagram_basic`
 7. `instagram_manage_messages`
 8. `business_management`
 9. `pages_read_engagement`
10. `whatsapp_business_management`

**Important Notes for Approval:**

1. To increase the likelihood of Meta's approval, include clear videos with on-screen text instructions demonstrating your integration setup.
2. For `whatsapp_business_management` approval, your video must explicitly show the creation of an **ice-breaker** under: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/phone-numbers/conversational-components#ice-breakers

## 8. Integrating with Existing Stripe Plans (Optional)

If you want to add Meta integrations to existing Stripe plans, ensure the metadata key `meta_integration` is set to `True` for those plans.
