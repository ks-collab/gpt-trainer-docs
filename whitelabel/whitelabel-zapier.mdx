## Whitelabel documentation

Before starting the Zapier app registration process, you will need to provision your own API documentation, similar to our guide here. We host our guide on [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/), and you can visit their [Quickstart guide](https://mintlify.com/docs/quickstart) to see how to do the same.

The files for our documentation are stored in our [public Github repository](https://github.com/ks-collab/gpt-trainer-docs). Feel free to refer to them when you create your own!
