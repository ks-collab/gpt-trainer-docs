title: Create Your First Chatbot
---

To get started, first log in to your account. If this is your first time using GPT-trainer, you will be asked to complete some 
initial onboarding steps. Afterwards, you will be presented with the ability to build an AI chatbot from one of our templates:

## Initial Setup

Click on "Create Chatbot". Then, you will be given a few personas to characterize your AI Agent based on your use case.

</Frame>

These personas have been predefined with a number of use-case-specific customizations, so they work out of the box, for the most part. 
Each persona has a different setup flow, but all of them should be very easy to follow.

Let's take Client Champion for example. After you select the persona, you can pick your AI Agent's specialty. In our case, we will go 
with Customer Support. Next, we tell the system which company the AI Agent represents, as well as the human support team's contact in case 
issues need to be escalated.

Depending on how strictly you want the AI Agent to stick to its training data (you will get the chance to provide this later), you can 
pick one of the options at the bottom. Let's pick "Rely only on given data" to be conservative for now.

Click "Continue". Then, since this is a client-facing chatbot, you will be asked to configure a data collection form from the user.

Here, you can define custom form fields, make certain fields mandatory, make the whole form mandatory, make the form show up only after 
certain number of Q&As, and much more. When you user submits the form, the data is collected and assocated with the conversation session. You can 
then export it as a CSV, or have it sent to you automatically by email or to a CRM via webhook.

<Note>
  If you don't want a form, simply hit "Skip step" on the top left next to the title.

Next, let's edit the appearance of the chat widget. In order to make it thematically consistent with the rest of your website, we have 
provided you with a large range of customization options, including font size, color, avatars, and more. We kept things simple for the template 
guide, so if you prefer, you can revisit more advanced settings under **Customizations** tab on the left navigation bar after your chatbot's initial setup is 
complete.

## Uploading Training Data

Finally, you are ready to train your AI Agent with your own data!

You can upload relevant training data (PDFs, Word, txt) or website sitemaps and URLs. If you have Excel tables, CSVs, images, or YouTube videos, you can 
upload them later in the **Sources** tab on the left navigation bar.

</Frame>

Click "Add to Sources".

Wait for the training to complete. Then, click "Try it out". GPT-trainer will open a new tab where you can start testing the 
preliminary chatbot.

In general, the chatbot should be well-configured enough as-is for most common use cases. However, if you would like to fine tune 
the chatbot behavior further, update the training data or appearance, or even add additional AI Agents to expand the chatbot's 
capabilities, you can do it by opening the chatbot and tweaking various options on the left navigation bar.

Close the chatbot testing tab. You will return to GPT-trainer's main interface. Go through the onboarding guide to learn more 
about your options.

When you are ready to deploy your chatbot, head to the **Go Live** tab.

If you want to share the chatbot as a standalone page, simply click **Link**. You should see a share link automatically generated for you.

If you want to embed the chatbot onto a web page, click **Website**. Detailed instructions will be displayed on the new right sidebar.

To add more chatbots, simply go to the left sidebar and click the dropdown menu. You will be taken to a dedicated page to manage all of your 
chatbots.

<Note>
  Please note that depending on your current subscription plan, there is a limit
  to the number of chatbots you can create.

## Interrupted Workflows

If you need to exit the browser at any point and return to your chatbot creation process later, you will see a screen similar to the 
image below. You can easily resume your chatbot creation process by clicking on the Work-In-Progress (WIP) chatbot card.
