title: User Identity Verification
---

This guide will walk you through implementing a robust authentication system within your chatbot.

## Step 1: Enable User Identity

To initiate the User Identity Verification process, you need to first enable this feature within your chatbot settings.
This can be done through the chatbot settings in "User Identity Verification" section.

Once the User Identity Verification is enabled your chatbot becomes equipped to automatically check for user tokens.
This means each time a user attempts to interact with the chatbot, their identity token will be reviewed for authenticity.

## Step 2: API Endpoint

### Setting Up the API Endpoint

It is essential to set up an API endpoint that will handle the verification of user tokens. This endpoint must be configured to accept POST requests.

1. **Specify the API Endpoint:** In your chatbot settings, provide the URL of the API endpoint. This is the server address where the token verification requests will be sent.

2. **Configure for POST Requests:** Ensure that your API endpoint is configured to handle POST requests. This is crucial as the GPT-trainer will send token data via POST requests for verification.

### Verification Process Flow

Here's what happens each time a chat is initiated:

1. **Token Submission:** Whenever a chat is rendered, GPT-trainer automatically sends a verification request to the provided API endpoint. This request includes the user's token.

2. **Processing the Request:** Your API endpoint should process this request, verifying the token's validity.

3. **Outcome Handling:**

   - **Successful Verification:** If the token is verified successfully, the chatbot will allow the authenticated user to proceed with the chat.
   - **Failed Verification:** In case the API returns an error (indicating a failed verification), the authentication will be deemed unsuccessful. Consequently, the user will be redirected to an error screen.

## Step 3: Save User's Data

To enhance the functionality of the User Identity Verification process and maintain records of user interactions,
you have the option to save the data from successful verification responses.

Every time a user is successfully authenticated, the response from the verification process (typically including user identification details) is stored.

This data is not stored in isolation but is linked with the specific chat conversations.

<Warning>
  **Only Valid JSON Data Accepted** - Please ensure that all data provided for
  storage is in valid JSON format. Non-JSON or invalid JSON data will be
  automatically ignored and not stored in the conversation history.
</Warning>

Example of valid JSON:

```json
{
  "userId": "12345",
  "userName": "JohnDoe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com",
  "verified": true,
  "roles": ["user", "admin"],
  "profile": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "age": 30
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Inserting Your Token into GPT-trainer Chatbot

### Chat Widget

Within the script of your webpage where the chatbot is integrated, locate the **GPTTConfig** object.
Here, you will need to update the **token** property with custom token. Here's an example script:

```html
<script>
  window.GPTTConfig = {
      uuid: "15b1f07cd591476c94c210779a6c3c19",
      token: <"Custom token">
  }
</script>
<script src="https://app.gpt-trainer.com/widget-asset.min.js" defer></script>
```

You can also directly update the **GPTTConfig** object with your token using a **JavaScript** call.
This method is particularly useful if you need to dynamically update the token based on user interactions or other triggers within your application. Here's how you can do it:

```JavaScript
  window.GPTTConfig.token = "Custom token";
```

When a change in the token property is detected, our system initiates an attempt to authenticate the user based on the new token value.
This ensures that the user's identity is verified each time they interact with the chatbot.

### Iframe

You can pass the user token directly within an iframe by including it in the URL property.
Append the **token** parameter to the **URL** in the src attribute, replacing **custom_token** with the actual token value. Here's an example:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://app.gpt-trainer.com/widget/162223v?token=<custom_token>"
  width="100%"
  height="500px"
  frameborder="0"
></iframe>
```

If there is a need to change the token, simply update the src attribute of the iframe with the new token value.

Upon updating the token in the URL, the iframe will reload, ensuring that the new token is used for authentication.

Congratulations! You have now successfully completed the setup of the User Identity Verification feature for your GPT-trainer Chatbot.
By following the steps outlined in this guide, you have enabled a robust and secure method for authenticating users, ensuring a safe and reliable user experience.
